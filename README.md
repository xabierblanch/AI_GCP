## üß† Overview

This project implements a modified **Keypoint R-CNN** (with **ResNet50-FPN** backbone) for the **automatic and sub-pixel accurate detection of Ground Control Points (GCPs)** in long-term time-lapse image series.  

Unlike other approaches, this is an **end-to-end method**: no pre- or post-processing is required, and no assumptions are made on GCP geometry, size, or color.

## üìÇ Datasets and Models

The model has been fine-tuned on three independent datasets with varying camera resolutions, image quality, and GCP typologies:

- **KIWA**: river monitoring, circular black/white targets  
- **Erosion4D**: hillslope monitoring, elevated circular markers  
- **Pulmankijoki**: sub-arctic riverbank erosion, arbitrary cross markers

Each dataset is associated with a dedicated trained model. Manual labeling was used for training; ellipse fitting and optical flow were used as baselines for evaluation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Features

- Modified **Keypoint R-CNN** to detect a **single keypoint** per object (instead of 17 human pose landmarks)  
- Compatible with standard PyTorch + TorchVision APIs  
- Custom data augmentation using **Albumentations**  
- Sub-pixel accuracy evaluation using:  
  - `mDist_pix`: median Euclidean distance in pixels  
  - `mDist_%`: pixel distance normalized by GCP size

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TorchVision Modifications

This project uses a **modified version of the Keypoint R-CNN implementation** from the TorchVision library. Specifically:

- The number of keypoints is reduced from **17 (COCO)** to **1**
- The **evaluation metrics** and **head architecture** have been adapted


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to use the **provided versions** of these files, or results may not be reproducible.

## üß™ Evaluation

The model was evaluated on all three datasets using both **absolute** and **relative** metrics.  
Results show **median errors below 1 pixel** across datasets, with **robust performance** under adverse conditions (e.g. blur, occlusion, low light).
